XMLsitemap
==========

Adds a configurable XML sitemap that conforms to the sitemaps.org specification.

An XML sitemap helps search engines to more intelligently crawl a website and
keep their results up to date. The sitemap created by the module can be
automatically submitted to Ask, Google, Bing (formerly Windows Live Search),
and Yahoo! search engines. The module also comes with several submodules that
can add sitemap links for content, menu items, taxonomy terms, and user
profiles.
