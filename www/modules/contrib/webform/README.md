Webform
=======

Webform is the module for making forms and surveys in Backdrop.

This module adds a webform content type to your Backdrop site.
A webform can be a questionnaire, contact or request form. These can be used
by visitor to make contact or to enable a more complex survey than polls
provide. Submissions from a webform are saved in a database table and
can optionally be mailed to e-mail addresses upon submission.

Results can be exported into Excel or other spreadsheet applications. Webform
also provides some basic statistical review and has an extensive API for
expanding its features.

Background
----------

Backdrop Webform is based on the Webform module for Drupal 7--starting at
version 7.x-4.4. For additional examples of Webform configuration, the
existing documentation and videos the Drupal 7 verison will likely be useful
for the Backdrop version as well. Note that Webform for Drupal 8 continues the
'Webform' name and serves the same general purpose, but is a different product
with different features and configuration.
