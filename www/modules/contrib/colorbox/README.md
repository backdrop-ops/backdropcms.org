COLORBOX
========

A light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.4.3+. Iframed or
inline images or content can be displayed in a popup or modal "lightbox" above
the current page.

The Colorbox module:

* Excellent integration with Image fields and Image styles
* Choose between a default style and 5 example styles that are included.
* Style the Colorbox with a custom colorbox.css file in your theme.

The Colorbox plugin:

* Supports photos, grouping, slideshow, ajax, inline, and iframed content.
* Appearance is controlled through CSS so it can be restyled.
* Preloads upcoming images in a photo group.
* Completely unobtrusive, options are set in the JS and require no changes to existing HTML.
* Released under the MIT License.

Installation
------------

Differences from Drupal
-----------------------

- If you would like to use HTML tags in colorbox captions, you will need to enable
  the new setting `Allow HTML in Colorbox captions`. This configuration will use
  the DOMpurify library for sanitization. Please note: **The DOMpurify library
  has several dependencies with security issues.** It is unknown whether the
  colorbox use of DOMpurify could introduce a vulnerablity to your site. For
  this reason it is recommend to leave this setting disabled.
- The Backdrop version of Colorbox module does not require that you download or
  install the Color library separately.
- The Backdrop version of Colorbox module does not require that you download or
