* Style the Colorbox with a custom colorbox.css file in your theme.

The Colorbox plugin:

* Supports photos, grouping, slideshow, ajax, inline, and iframed content.
* Appearance is controlled through CSS so it can be restyled.
* Preloads upcoming images in a photo group.
* Completely unobtrusive, options are set in the JS and require no changes to existing HTML.
