## Reporting a Vulnerability

First of all, please immediately contact us via [email](mailto:mario@cure53.de) so we can work on a fix. [PGP key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC26C858090F70ADA)

Also, you probably qualify for a bug bounty! The fine folks over at [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) use DOMPurify for their services and added our library to their bug bounty scope. So, if you find a way to bypass or weaken DOMPurify, please also have a look at their website and the [bug bounty info](https://www.fastmail.com/about/bugbounty.html).
