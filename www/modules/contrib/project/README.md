Project
=======

This is a suite of modules used on BackdropCMS.org to provide listings of
projects such as modules, themes, and layouts. The base module simply
provides the ability to mark certain content types as "projects". Additional
modules then extend this ability, including the following sub-modules:

- Project Release: Create releases that map to a versioned, downloadable file.
- Project Usage: Maintain historical information on project installs.
- Project GitHub: Populate project and release information from GitHub.

Although this module is based upon the [Drupal Project module]
(https://www.drupal.org/project/project), it is smaller in scope.
This project does not include an issue tracker or maintainer access controls.

Installation
