ezcMailComposerOptions
======================

- Cast to bool is not necessary in Mail/src/options/composer_options.php +75.

# Done.

SMTP Auth methods
=================

- Why is there only a failure case tested? I don't see (at a first glance)
  that the sorting is really tested at all. If I'm wrong with that: Please add
  a comment to the test. Thanks!

# I added a comment to the test.

Testing
=======

- 1 failure with 5.2.6 on ezctest: ::

	1) testValidateEmailAddressIncorrect(ezcMailToolsTest)
	Failed asserting that Âµ@example.com is incorrect.
	Failed asserting that <boolean:true> matches expected value <boolean:false>.
	/home/ts/dev/ezc/trunk/Mail/tests/tools_test.php:273

- Some failures and nasty output on my local maschine (maybe these tests can be
  conditionally skipped?): ::

# I don't know anything about this behaviour in MTA. What system do you have on
  your PC? Do you have sendmail? The MTA transport uses the mail() function which
  is not easy to control and which can output text to the console. Not much to do
  here unless somebody knows something. (Note: is hartes-php.de functional?
  I cannot connect to it with telnet)

# About the ezcMailToolsTest failure: there was a bug in the getmxrr() PHP
  function and I think the failure is caused by that. But we could not find which
  bug was it and in which version it was fixed. With what version of PHP did you test?
