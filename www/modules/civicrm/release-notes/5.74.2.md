## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: "Update Recurring Contribution" fails to open ([dev/core#5282](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/5282): [#30410](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/30410))**
* **_CiviGrant_: Disabling CiviGrant leads to errors about "CRM_Utils_SQL::mergeSubquery" ([dev/core#5284](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/5284): [#30404](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/30404))**

  Other disabled extensions might provoke similar errors, but this has not been specifically tested.
