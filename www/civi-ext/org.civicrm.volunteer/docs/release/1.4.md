# New Features in CiviVolunteer 1.4

[Ginkgo Street Labs](http://ginkgostreet.com) is excited to announce the
release of CiviVolunteer 1.4 for CiviCRM 4.5.x and 4.6.x! This release
was made possible by funding from [Manhattan Neighborhood
Network](http://www.mnn.org), the country's largest community media
center.

## New Features at a Glance

-   The new skill assessment widget represents levels of ability on a
    continuum. When a user drags the slider, the current option (e.g.,
    "Master") as well as all options with a lower weight are selected.
    As a result, a search for volunteers qualified to do
    "Apprentice"-level work will include volunteers with "Master"-level
    skills.
-   Search for volunteers from the assignment interface. Having a hard
    time finding a gaffer for the next episode of your public access
    program? Filter candidates by custom fields or by group membership,
    and draft the last member of your crew!
-   Volunteer commendation. Did someone stand out at the last river
    cleanup? Now it's easy to recognize their exceptional performance.
-   Volunteers can now express interest in volunteering by filling out a
    customizable form at
    [http://example.org/civicrm/volunteer/join](http://example.org/civicrm/volunteer/join).
    Unlike the sign-up forms you're accustomed to seeing in
    CiviVolunteer, this won't associate volunteers with a particular
    project; it's a general purpose sign-up form.
-   Tailor the questions you ask volunteers by specifying the profile to
    use for each volunteer project's sign up form. Or specify more than
    one!
