## Steps

Use the following steps to install GDPR.

1. **Administer > System Settings > Extensions**
1. **Add New**
1. Sort by name
1. Find, download, and install this extension:
    * ** General Data Protection Regulation**

1. If necessary, click Enable after the extension has been downloaded and installed. When the extension is enabled:

    * GDPR should show up as green-highlighted.
    * The option to **Disable** it will be present.

1. Next grant appropriate permissions (see below)

## Permissions {:#permissions}

The GDPR extension adds 3 new permissions which should be configured within your CMS before the extension can be used.
See [Permissions and access control](/user/en/latest/initial-set-up/permissions-and-access-control) the CiviCRM User Guide for more information.


## Discovering features after installing {:#discovery}

After installing, GDPR’s features can be found in the following places:

* A GDPR Dashboard link in the CiviCRM 'Contacts’ menu
* A GDPR tab within a contacts record

You will need to complete the GDPR settings in the GDPR dashboard.

## Removing

If you no longer wish to use GDPR, you may disable it, or uninstall it.

* **Disable** - will turn off GDPR’s features, but preserve any data that you have created with it. If you re-enable GDPR later, you'll be back where you left off. 
* **Uninstall** - can be done after disabling, and will completely remove all traces of GDRP, including the data created with it. If you re-install GDPR later, you'll be back to square one, before you ever installed it.
