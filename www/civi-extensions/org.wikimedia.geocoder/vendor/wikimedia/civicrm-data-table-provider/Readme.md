# Data table geocoder

This is a geocoder plugin to use a mysql table based geocoding dataset with CiviCRM. It uses CiviCRM specific functions & is not generic to other apps.

To use with other apps a more generic db interface would be needed.
 

### Install

```bash
composer require wikimedia/data-table-provider
```
