# GDPR

The [GDPR extension](https://github.com/veda-consulting/uk.co.vedaconsulting.gdpr) aims to enable charities/organisations to manage their supporters in a GDPR compliant manner. GDPR in itself does not introduce many new requirements however it does introduce a number of new obligations on organisations that hold and use data about individuals.
