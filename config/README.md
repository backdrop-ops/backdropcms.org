# Config Workflow Instructions

These instructions explain BackdropCMS.org's Configuration Management workflow.
For an overview of config management, see the
[API docs](https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/working-configuration).
BackdropCMS.org uses the
'[Versioned staging directory](https://api.backdropcms.org/documentation/versioned-staging-directory)'
approach with a few changes (namely the inclusion of the `live-active` directory
in version control).

## Rule #1

**Never commit anything into the `live-active` directory!**

'Live' config will only ever be added and committed to directly from the live
server. All changes that need to be made to configuration should be added and
committed to the staging directory, so it can be safely deployed to any
environment.

## Making config changes in a PR/commit

### Setup

1. Make sure your local `settings.php` file has the following directories
   defined:
   ```php
   $config_directories['active'] = '../config/dev-active';
   $config_directories['staging'] = '../config/staging';
   ```

2. Check that `live-active` is an exact match to what's on BackdropCMS.org (ask
   someone in a GitHub ticket or in Gitter to confirm this for you). See note
   below.

3. Copy the contents of the `live-active` directory into the `staging`
   directory. The best way to do this is to first delete everything in
   `staging`, then copy everything from `live-active`. These two directories
   need to be an exact match.

4. Synchronize config on your local environment to bring your `dev-active`
   directory up-to-date with `staging` (and thus also `live-active`). You can do
   this via the UI at `/admin/config/development/configuration`, or with Drush
   via `drush bcim`.

5. Perform a `git checkout` on the staging directory.

### Make your changes

1. Make your changes to code and/or config in your local environment.

2. Commit just the code changes (don't include any changes to config yet).

3. Copy the contents of the `dev-active` directory into the `staging` directory.
   The best way to do this is to first delete everything in `staging`, then copy
   everything from `dev-active`. These two directories need to be an exact
   match. If you have Drush installed, you can simply run `drush bcex`.

4. Confirm that all of the changes you see in the `staging` directory are
   changes you want to deploy live (using `git status` and/or `git diff`). Note
   that:

   - You do not usually want to commit changes to `system.core.json`
   - The file `xmlsitemap.settings.json` may also report unintended changes

   Perform a `git checkout` on any changes you do **not** want to deploy.

5. Commit the config changes.

6. Push your changes, create a PR, etc.

## Updating `live-active`

**These instructions are solely for people with access to the live server who
have been asked to make sure `live-active` is up-to-date as per step 2 of the
Setup instructions above.**

1. On Backdrop's live server, perform a `git status` to see if there are any
   uncommitted changes to the `live-active` config directory.

2. If there are no uncommitted changes, skip to step 5.

3. Copy the contents of the `live-active` directory into the `staging`
   directory. The best way to do this is to first delete everything in
   `staging`, then copy everything from `live-active`. These two directories
   need to be an exact match.

4. Commit the changes to `live-active` and `staging`.

5. Inform the user that `live-active` is up-to-date.
