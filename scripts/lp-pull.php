 * Get the latest sanitized database for local development.
 *
 * This will only work if you have the creds set up in your .env file.
 *
 * If you don't have those creds, but would like to contribute to the
 * backdropcms.org code base please request them on:
 * Zulip: https://backdrop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/218635-Backdrop
 *
 * or file a new issue on
 * https://github.com/backdrop-ops/backdropcms.org/issues/
 *
 * requesting either a copy of the DB or access to creds.
 *
 * Allotting access to creds will be made on a case by case basis.
 *
 * If you have the creds make sure to set them in your .env file and
 * do a `lando rebuild -y` to let lando load the env vars into the app.
 *
 * The variables required are the LP_* vars.
 * LP stands for lando pull.
 *
 * LP_USER is the htpassword user for sanitize.b.org.
 * LP_PASS is the htpassword password for sanitize.b.org.
 * LP_DB_URL is the URL where s.b.org puts the sanitized databases.
 * LP_FILES_URL is the url where s.b.org puts the files backups.
